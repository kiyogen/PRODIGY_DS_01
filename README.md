## Task 1: Visualizing a Continuous and Categorical Variable

This task is part of my Prodigy Infotech internship.  
The objective was to visualize the distribution of either a continuous or a categorical variable.  
I chose to work with **population data** across countries and years.

### Contents
- `Task1.ipynb` → Code for visualization  
- `dataset1.csv` → Population dataset (1960–2024, multiple countries)  
- Output plots → histogram visualizations  

### Approach
- **Categorical distribution**: Bar chart showing the population distribution across countries for a chosen year.  
- **Continuous distribution**: Histogram showing the spread of population values across countries. A log scale was applied to handle large differences between the population of the countries.

### Libraries Used
- Python 3  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib
